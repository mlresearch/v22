title: Bandit Theory meets Compressed Sensing for high dimensional Stochastic Linear
  Bandit
abstract: "We consider a linear stochastic bandit problem where the dimension K of
  the unknown parameter \theta is larger than the sampling budget n. Since usual linear
  bandit algorithms have a regret in O(K\\sqrtn), it is in general impossible to obtain
  a sub-linear regret without further assumption. In this paper we make the assumption
  that \theta is S-sparse, i.e. has at most S-non-zero components, and that the space
  of arms is the unit ball for the ||.||_2 norm. We combine ideas from Compressed
  Sensing and Bandit Theory to derive an algorithm with a regret bound in O(S\\sqrtn).
  We detail an application to the problem of optimizing a function that depends on
  many variables but among which only a small number of them (initially unknown) are
  relevant."
