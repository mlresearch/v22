title: Bandit Theory meets Compressed Sensing for high dimensional Stochastic Linear
  Bandit
abstract: "We consider a linear stochastic bandit problem where the dimension K of
  the unknown parameter \theta is larger than the sampling budget n. Since usual linear
  bandit algorithms have a regret in O(K\\sqrt{n}), it is in general impossible to
  obtain a sub-linear regret without further assumption. In this paper we make the
  assumption that \theta is S-sparse, i.e. has at most S-non-zero components, and
  that the space of arms is the unit ball for the ||.||_2 norm. We combine ideas from
  Compressed Sensing and Bandit Theory to derive an algorithm with a regret bound
  in O(S\\sqrt{n}). We detail an application to the problem of optimizing a function
  that depends on many variables but among which only a small number of them (initially
  unknown) are relevant."
