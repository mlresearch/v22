title: Flexible Martingale Priors for Deep Hierarchies
abstract: When building priors over trees for Bayesian hierarchical models, there
  is a tension between maintaining desirable theoretical properties such as infinite
  exchangeability and important practical properties such as the ability to increase
  the depth of the tree to accommodate new data. We resolve this tension by presenting
  a family of infinitely exchangeable priors over discrete tree structures that allows
  the depth of the tree to grow with the data, and then showing that our family contains
  all hierarchical models with certain mild symmetry properties. We also show that
  deep hierarchical models are in general intimately tied to a process called a martingale,
  and use Doobâ€™s martingale convergence theorem to demonstrate some unexpected properties
  of deep hierarchies.
