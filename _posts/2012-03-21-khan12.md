title: A Stick-Breaking Likelihood for Categorical Data Analysis with Latent Gaussian
  Models
abstract: The development of accurate models and efficient algorithms for the analysis
  of multivariate categorical data are important and long-standing problems in machine
  learning and computational statistics. In this paper, we focus on modeling categorical
  data using Latent Gaussian Models (LGMs). We propose a novel stick-breaking likelihood
  function for categorical LGMs that exploits accurate linear and quadratic bounds
  on the logistic log-partition function, leading to an effective variational inference
  and learning framework. We thoroughly compare our approach to existing algorithms
  for multinomial logit/probit likelihoods on several problems, including inference
  in multinomial Gaussian process classification and learning in latent factor models.
  Our extensive comparisons demonstrate that our stick-breaking model effectively
  captures correlation in discrete data and is well suited for the analysis of categorical
  data.
