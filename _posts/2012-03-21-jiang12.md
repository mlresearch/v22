title: Detecting Network Cliques with Radon Basis Pursuit
abstract: 'In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of the network clique detection
  problem by introducing a general network data representation framework. We show
  connections between our formulation with a new algebraic tool, namely Radon basis
  pursuit in homogeneous spaces. Such a connection allows us to identify rigorous
  recovery conditions for clique detection problems. Practical approximation algorithms
  are also developed for solving empirical problems and their usefulness is demonstrated
  on real-world datasets. Our work connects two seemingly different areas: network
  data analysis and compressed sensing, which helps to bridge the gap between the
  research of network data and the classical theory of statistical learning and signal
  processing.'
