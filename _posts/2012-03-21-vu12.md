title: Minimax Rates of Estimation for Sparse PCA in High Dimensions
abstract: We study sparse principal components analysis in the high-dimensional setting,
  where p (the number of variables) can be much larger  than n (the number of observations).
  We prove optimal minimax lower and upper bounds on the estimation error for the
  first leading eigenvector when it belongs to an \ell_q ball for q ∈[0,1]. Our bounds
  are tight in p and n for all q ∈[0, 1] over a wide class of distributions. The upper
  bound is obtained by analyzing  the performance of \ell_q-constrained PCA. In particular,
  our results provide convergence rates for \ell_1-constrained PCA. Our methods and
  arguments are also extendable to multi-dimensional subspace estimation.
