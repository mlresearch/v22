title: Local Anomaly Detection
abstract: Anomalies with spatial and temporal stamps arise in a number of applications
  including communication networks, traffic monitoring and video analysis. In these
  applications anomalies are temporally or spatially localized but otherwise unknown.
  We propose a novel graph-based statistical notion that unifies the idea of temporal
  and spatial locality. This notion lends itself to an elegant characterization of
  optimal decision rules and in turn suggests corresponding empirical rules based
  on local nearest neighbor distances. We compute a single composite score for the
  entire spatio-temporal data sample based on the local neighborhood distances. We
  declare data samples as containing local anomalies based on the composite score.
  We show that such rules not only asymptotically guarantee desired false alarm control
  but are also asymptotically optimal. We also show that our composite scoring scheme
  overcomes the inherent resolution issues of alternative multi-comparison approaches
  that are based on fusing the outcomes of location-by-location comparisons. We then
  verify our algorithms on synthetic and real data sets.
