title: Informative Priors for Markov Blanket Discovery
abstract: We present a novel interpretation of information theoretic feature selection
  as optimization of a discriminative model. We show that this formulation coincides
  with a group of mutual information based filter heuristics in the literature, and
  show how our probabilistic framework gives a well-founded extension for informative
  priors. We then derive a particular sparsity prior that recovers the well-known
  IAMB algorithm (Tsamardinos & Aliferis, 2003) and extend it to create a novel algorithm,
  IAMB-IP, that includes domain knowledge priors. In empirical evaluations, we find
  the new algorithm to improve Markov Blanket recovery even when a misspecified prior
  was used, in which half the prior knowledge was incorrect.
