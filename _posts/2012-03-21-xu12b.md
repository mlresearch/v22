title: Robust Multi-task Regression with Grossly Corrupted Observations
abstract: 'We consider the multiple-response regression problem, where the response
  is subject to *sparse gross errors*, in the high-dimensional setup. We propose a
  tractable regularized M-estimator that is robust to such error, where the sum of
  two individual regularization terms are used: the first one encourages row-sparse
  regression parameters, and the second one encourages a sparse error term. We obtain
  non-asymptotical  estimation error bounds of the proposed method. To the best of
  our knowledge, this is the first analysis of the robust multi-task regression problem
  with gross errors.'
