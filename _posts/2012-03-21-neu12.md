title: The adversarial stochastic shortest path problem with unknown transition probabilities
abstract: We consider online learning in a special class of episodic Markovian decision
  processes, namely, loop-free stochastic shortest path problems. In this problem,
  an agent has to traverse through a finite directed acyclic graph with random transitions
  while maximizing the obtained rewards along the way. We assume that the reward function
  can change arbitrarily between consecutive episodes, and is entirely revealed to
  the agent at the end of each episode. Previous work was concerned with the case
  when the stochastic dynamics is known ahead of time,  whereas the main novelty of
  this paper is that this assumption is lifted. We propose an algorithm called “follow
  the perturbed optimistic policy” that combines ideas from the “follow the perturbed
  leader”  method for online learning of arbitrary sequences and “upper confidence
  reinforcement learning”, an algorithm for regret minimization in Markovian decision
  processes (with a fixed reward function). We prove that the expected cumulative
  regret of our algorithm is of order L X A\sqrtT up to logarithmic factors, where
  L is the length of the longest path in the graph, \X is the state space, \A is the
  action space and T is the number of episodes. To our knowledge this is the first
  algorithm that learns and controls stochastic and adversarial components in an online
  fashion at the same time.
