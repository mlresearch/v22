title: Bayesian Quadrature for Ratios
abstract: We describe a novel approach to quadrature for ratios of probabilistic integrals,
  such as are used to compute posterior probabilities. It offers performance superior
  to Monte Carlo methods by exploiting a Bayesian quadrature framework. We improve
  upon previous Bayesian quadrature techniques by explicitly modelling the non-negativity
  of our integrands, and the correlations that exist between them. It offers most
  where the integrand is multi-modal and expensive to evaluate, as is commonplace
  in exoplanets research; we demonstrate the efficacy of our method on data from the
  Kepler spacecraft.
