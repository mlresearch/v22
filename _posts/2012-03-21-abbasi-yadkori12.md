title: Online-to-Confidence-Set Conversions and Application to Sparse Stochastic Bandits
abstract: We introduce a novel technique, which we call  online-to-confidence-set
  conversion. The technique allows us to construct high-probability confidence sets
  for linear prediction  with correlated inputs given the predictions of any algorithm   (e.g.,
  online LASSO, exponentiated gradient algorithm,   online least-squares, p-norm algorithm)   targeting
  online learning  with linear predictors and the quadratic loss. By construction,
  the size of the confidence set is   directly governed by the regret of the online
  learning algorithm. Constructing tight confidence sets is interesting on its own,
  but  the new technique is given extra weight by the fact   having access tight confidence
  sets underlies a number of    important problems. The advantage of our construction
  here is that  progress in constructing better algorithms for online prediction problems   directly
  translates into tighter confidence sets. In this paper, this is demonstrated in
  the case of linear stochastic bandits. In particular, we introduce the sparse variant
  of linear stochastic  bandits and show that a recent online algorithm together with
  our  online-to-confidence-set conversion allows one to derive  algorithms that can
  exploit if the reward is a function of a sparse   linear combination of the components
  of the chosen action.
