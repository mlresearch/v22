title: Multiple Texture Boltzmann Machines
abstract: We assess the generative power of the mPoT-model of [10] with tiled-convolutional
  weight sharing as a model for visual textures by specifically training on this task,
  evaluating model performance on texture synthesis and inpainting tasks using quantitative
  metrics. We also analyze the relative importance of the mean and covariance parts
  of the mPoT model by comparing its performance to those of its subcomponents, tiled-convolutional
  versions of the PoT/FoE and Gaussian-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (GB-RBM).
  Our results suggest that while state-of-the-art or better performance can be achieved
  using the mPoT, similar performance can be achieved with the mean-only model. We
  then develop a model for multiple textures based on the GB-RBM, using a shared set
  of weights but texture-specific hidden unit biases. We show comparable performance
  of the multiple texture model to  individually trained texture models.
