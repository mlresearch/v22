title: Subset Infinite Relational Models
abstract: We propose a new probabilistic generative model for analyzing sparse and
  noisy pairwise relational data, such as friend-links on SNSs and customer records
  in online shops. Real-world relational data often include a large portion of non-informative
  pairwise data entries.  Many existing stochastic blockmodels suffer from these irrelevant
  data entries because of their rather simpler forms of priors. The proposed model
  newly incorporates a latent variable that explicitly indicates whether each data
  entry is relevant or not to diminish the bad effects associated with such irrelevant
  data.  Through experimental results using synthetic and real data sets, we show
  that the proposed model can extract clusters with stronger relations among data
  within the cluster than clusters obtained by the conventional model.
