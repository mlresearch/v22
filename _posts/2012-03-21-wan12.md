title: A Hybrid Neural Network-Latent Topic Model
abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid model that combines a neural network with
  a latent topic model. The neural network provides a low dimensional embedding for
  the input data, whose subsequent distribution is captured by the topic model. The
  neural network thus acts as a trainable feature extractor while the topic model
  captures the group structure of the data. Following an initial pretraining phase
  to separately initialize each part of the model, a unified training scheme is introduced
  that allows for discriminative training of the entire model. The approach is evaluated
  on visual data in scene classification task, where the hybrid model is shown to
  outperform models based solely on neural networks or topic models, as well as other
  baseline methods.
