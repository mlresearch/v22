title: Wilks' phenomenon and penalized likelihood-ratio test for nonparametric curve
  registration
abstract: "The problem of curve registration appears in many different areas of applications
  ranging from neuroscience to road traffic modeling. In the present work, we propose
  a nonparametric testing framework in which we develop a generalized likelihood ratio
  test to perform curve registration. We first prove that,  under the null hypothesis,
  \ the resulting test statistic is asymptotically distributed as a chi-squared random
  variable (Wilks' phenomenon). We also prove that the proposed test is consistent,
  \textit{i.e.}, its power is asymptotically equal to $1$. Finite sample properties
  of the proposed methodology are demonstrated by numerical simulations."
