title: Memory-efficient inference in dynamic graphical models using multiple cores
abstract: 'We introduce the archipelagos algorithm for memory-efficient multi-core
  inference in dynamic graphical models. By making use of several processors running
  in parallel, the archipelagos algorithm uses exponentially less memory compared
  to basic forward-backward message passing algorithms (O(log T) compared to O(T)
  on sequences of length T) and, under often-satisfied assumptions on the relative
  speed of passing forward and backward messages, runs no slower. We also describe
  a simple variant of the algorithm that achieves a factor of two speedup over forward-backward
  on a single core. Experiments with our implementation of archipelagos for the computation
  of posterior marginal probabilities in an HMM validate the space/time complexity
  analysis: using four cores, the required memory on our test problem was reduced
  from 8 GB to 319 KB (a factor of 25000) relative to forward-backward, but completed
  in essentially the same time. The archipelagos algorithm applies to any dynamic
  graphical model, including dynamic Bayesian networks, conditional random fields,
  and hidden conditional random fields.'
