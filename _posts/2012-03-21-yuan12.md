title: Forward Basis Selection for Sparse Approximation over Dictionary
abstract: Recently, forward greedy selection method has been successfully applied
  to approximately solve sparse learning problems, characterized by a trade-off between
  sparsity and accuracy. In this paper, we generalize this method to the setup of
  sparse approximation over a pre-fixed dictionary. A fully corrective forward selection
  algorithm is proposed along with convergence analysis. The per-iteration computational
  overhead of the proposed algorithm is dominated by a subproblem of linear optimization
  over the dictionary and a subproblem to optimally adjust the aggregation weights.
  The former is cheaper in several applications than the Euclidean projection while
  the latter is typically an unconstrained optimization problem which is relatively
  easy to solve. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithm to the setting of non-negative/convex
  sparse approximation over a dictionary.Applications of our algorithms to several
  concrete learning problems are explored with efficiency validated on benchmark data
  sets.
