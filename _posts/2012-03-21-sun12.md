title: Efficient and Exact MAP-MRF Inference using Branch and Bound
abstract: We propose two novel Branch-and-Bound (BB) methods to efficiently solve
  exact MAP-MRF inference on problems with a large number of states (per variable)
  H. By organizing the data in a suitable structure, the time complexity of our best
  method for evaluating the bound at each branch is reduced from O(H^2) to O(H). This
  permits searching for the MAP solution in O(BH+Q) instead of O(BH^2) (without using
  the data structure), where B is the number of branches and Q is the one-time cost
  to build the data structure which is proportional to H^2. Our analysis on synthetic
  data shows that, given a limited time budget, our method solves problems that are
  characterized by a much larger number of states when compared to state-of-the-art
  exact inference algorithms (e.g., Marinescu and Dechter (2007); Sontag et al. (2008))
  and other baseline BB methods. We further show that our method is well suited for
  computer vision and computational biology problems where the state space (per variable)
  is large. In particular, our approach is an order of magnitude faster on average
  than Sontag et al.’s Cluster Pursuit (CP) on human pose estimation problems. Moreover,
  given a time budget of up to 20 minutes, our method consistently solves more protein
  design problems than CP does. Finally, we successfully explore different branching
  strategies and ways to utilize domain knowledge of the problem to significantly
  reduce the empirical inference time.
