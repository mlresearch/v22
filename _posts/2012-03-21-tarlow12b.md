title: Randomized Optimum Models for Structured Prediction
abstract: One approach to modeling structured discrete data is to describe the   probability
  of states via an energy function and Gibbs distribution.   A recurring difficulty
  in these models is the computation of the   partition function, which may require
  an intractable sum.  However,   in many such models, the mode can be found efficiently
  even when the partition   function is unavailable.  Recent work on Perturb-and-MAP
  (PM)   models (Papandreou and Yuille, 2011) has exploited this discrepancy to   approximate
  the Gibbs distribution for Markov random fields (MRFs).   Here, we explore a broader
  class of models, called  Randomized Optimum Models (RandOMs), which include PM as
  a special   case.  This new class of models encompasses not only MRFs, but also
  other models that have intractable partition   functions yet permit efficient mode-finding,
  such as those based on bipartite   matchings, shortest paths, or connected components
  in a graph.  We develop   likelihood-based learning algorithms for RandOMs, which,   empirical
  results indicate, can produce better models   than PM.
