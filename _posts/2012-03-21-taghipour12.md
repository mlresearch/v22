title: Lifted Variable Elimination with Arbitrary Constraints
abstract: Lifted probabilistic inference algorithms exploit regularities in the structure
  of graphical models to perform inference more efficiently. More specifically, they
  identify groups of interchangeable variables and perform inference once for each
  group, as opposed to once for each variable. The groups are defined by means of
  constraints, so the flexibility of the grouping is determined by the expressivity
  of the constraint language. Existing approaches for exact lifted inference rely
  on (in)equality constraints. We show how inference methods can be generalized to
  work with arbitrary constraints. This allows them to capture a broader range of
  symmetries, leading to more opportunities for lifting. We empirically demonstrate
  that this improves inference efficiency with orders of magnitude, allowing exact
  inference in cases where until now only approximate inference was feasible.
