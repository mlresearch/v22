title: Bayesian Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms on Single and Multiple Datasets
abstract: We propose a new method for comparing learning algorithms on multiple tasks
  which is based on a novel non-parametric test that we call the Poisson binomial
  test. The key aspect of this work is that we provide a formal definition for what
  is meant to have an algorithm that is better than another. Also, we are able to
  take into account the dependencies induced when evaluating classifiers on the same
  test set. Finally we make optimal use (in the Bayesian sense) of all the testing
  data we have. We demonstrate empirically that our approach is more reliable than
  the sign test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test, the current state of the art for
  algorithm comparisons.
