title: Stick-Breaking Beta Processes and the Poisson Process
abstract: We show that the stick-breaking construction of the beta process due to
  \citePaisley:2010 can be obtained from the characterization of the beta process
  as a Poisson process.  Specifically, we show that the mean measure of the underlying
  Poisson process is equal to that of the beta process. We use this underlying representation
  to derive error bounds on truncated beta processes that are tighter than those in
  the literature. We also develop a new MCMC inference algorithm for beta processes,
  based in part on our new Poisson process construction.
