title: Adaptive Metropolis with Online Relabeling
abstract: We propose a novel adaptive MCMC algorithm named AMOR (Adaptive Metropolis
  with Online Relabeling) for efficiently simulating from permutation-invariant targets
  occurring in, for example, Bayesian analysis of mixture models. An important feature
  of the algorithm is to tie the adaptation of the proposal distribution to the choice
  of a particular restriction of the target to a domain where label switching cannot
  occur. The algorithm relies on a stochastic approximation procedure for which we
  exhibit a Lyapunov function that formally defines the criterion used for selecting
  the relabeling rule. This criterion reveals an interesting connection with the problem
  of optimal quantifier design in vector quantization which was only implicit in previous
  works on the label switching problem. In benchmark examples, the algorithm turns
  out to be fast converging and efficient at selecting meaningful non-trivial relabeling
  rules to allow accurate parameter inference.
