title: 'A metric learning perspective of SVM: on the relation of LMNN and SVM'
abstract: Support Vector Machines, SVMs, and the Large Margin Nearest Neighbor algorithm,
  LMNN, are two very popular learning algorithms with quite different learning biases.
  In this paper we bring them into a unified view and show that they have a much stronger
  relation than what is commonly thought. We analyze SVMs from a metric learning perspective
  and cast them as a metric learning problem, a view which helps us uncover the relations  of
  the two algorithms. We show that LMNN can be seen as learning a set of local SVM-like
  models in a quadratic space. Along the way and  inspired by the metric-based interpretation
  of SVMs we derive a novel variant of SVMs, \epsilon-SVM, to which LMNN is even more
  similar.  We give a unified view of  LMNN and the different SVM variants. Finally
  we provide some preliminary experiments on a number of benchmark datasets in which
  show that \epsilon-SVM compares favorably both with respect to LMNN and SVM.
