title: Active Learning from Multiple Knowledge Sources
abstract: Some supervised learning tasks do not fit the usual single annotator scenario.
  In these problems, ground-truth may not exist and multiple annotators are generally
  available. A few approaches have been proposed to address this learning problem.
  In this setting active learning (AL), the problem of optimally selecting unlabeled
  samples for labeling, offers new challenges and has received little attention. In
  multiple annotator AL, it is not sufficient to select a sample for labeling since,
  in addition, an optimal annotator must also be selected. This setting is of great
  interest as annotatorsâ€™ expertise generally varies and could depend on the given
  sample itself; additionally, some annotators may be adversarial. Thus, clearly the
  information provided by some annotators should be more valuable than that provided
  by others and it could vary across data points. We propose an AL approach for this
  new scenario motivated by information theoretic principles. Specifically, we focus
  on maximizing the information that an annotator label provides about the true (but
  unknown) label of the data point. We develop this concept, propose an algorithm
  for active learning, and experimentally validate the proposed approach.
