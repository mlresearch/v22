title: Nonparametric Estimation of Conditional Information and Divergences
abstract: In this paper we propose new nonparametric estimators for a family of conditional
  mutual information and divergences. Our estimators are easy to compute; they only
  use simple k nearest neighbor based statistics. We prove that the proposed conditional
  information and divergence estimators are consistent under certain conditions, and
  demonstrate their consistency and applicability by numerical experiments on simulated
  and on real data as well.
