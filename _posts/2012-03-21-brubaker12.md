title: A Family of MCMC Methods on Implicitly Defined Manifolds
abstract: Traditional MCMC methods are only applicable to distributions which can
  be defined on \mathbbR^n. However, there exist many application domains where the
  distributions cannot easily be defined on a Euclidean space. To address this limitation,
  we propose a general constrained version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and  give conditions
  under which the Markov chain  is convergent. Based on this general framework we
  define a family of MCMC methods which can be applied to sample from distributions
  on non-linear manifolds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach  on a
  variety of problems including sampling from the Bingham-von Mises-Fisher distribution,
  collaborative filtering and  human pose estimation.
