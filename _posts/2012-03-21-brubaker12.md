title: A Family of MCMC Methods on Implicitly Defined Manifolds
abstract: Traditional MCMC methods are only applicable to distributions which can
  be defined on $\mathbb{R}^n$. However, there exist many application domains where
  the distributions cannot easily be defined on a Euclidean space. To address this
  limitation, we propose a general constrained version of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,
  and  give conditions under which the Markov chain  is convergent. Based on this
  general framework we define a family of MCMC methods which can be applied to sample
  from distributions on non-linear manifolds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
  our approach  on a variety of problems including sampling from the Bingham-von Mises-Fisher
  distribution, collaborative filtering and  human pose estimation.
