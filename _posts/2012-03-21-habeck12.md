title: Evaluation of marginal likelihoods via the density of states
abstract: Bayesian model comparison involves the evaluation of the marginal likelihood,
  the expectation of the likelihood under the prior distribution. Typically, this
  high-dimensional integral over all model parameters is approximated using Markov
  chain Monte Carlo methods. Thermodynamic integration is a popular method to estimate
  the marginal likelihood by using samples from annealed posteriors. Here we show
  that there exists a robust and flexible alternative. The new method estimates the
  density of states, which counts the number of states associated with a particular
  value of the likelihood. If the density of states is known, computation of the marginal
  likelihood reduces to a one- dimensional integral. We outline a maximum likelihood
  procedure to estimate the density of states from annealed posterior samples. We
  apply our method to various likelihoods and show that it is superior to thermodynamic
  integration in that it is more flexible with regard to the annealing schedule and
  the family of bridging distributions. Finally, we discuss the relation of our method
  with Skillingâ€™s nested sampling.
