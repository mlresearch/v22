title: Semiparametric Pseudo-Likelihood Estimation in Markov Random Fields
abstract: Probabilistic graphical models for continuous variables can be built out
  of either parametric or nonparametric conditional density estimators. While several
  research efforts have been focusing on parametric approaches (such as Gaussian models),
  kernel-based estimators are still the only viable and well-understood option for
  nonparametric density estimation. This paper develops a semiparametric estimator
  of probability density functions based on the nonparanormal transformation, which
  has been recently proposed for mapping arbitrarily distributed data samples onto
  normally distributed datasets. Pointwise and uniform consistency properties are
  established for the developed method. The resulting density model is then applied
  to pseudo-likelihood estimation in Markov random fields. An experimental evaluation
  on data distributed according to a variety of density functions indicates that such
  semiparametric Markov random field models significantly outperform both their Gaussian
  and kernel-based alternatives in terms of prediction accuracy.
