title: A Two-Graph Guided Multi-task Lasso Approach for eQTL Mapping
abstract: Learning a small number of genetic variants associated with multiple complex
  genetic traits is of practical importance and remains challenging due to the high
  dimensional nature of data. In this paper, we proposed a two-graph guided multi-task
  Lasso to address this issue with an emphasis on estimating subnetwork-to-subnetwork
  associations in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping. The proposed
  model can learn such subnetwork-to-subnetwork associations and therefore can be
  seen as a generalization of several state-of-the-art multi-task feature selection
  methods. Additionally, this model has a nice property of allowing flexible structured
  sparsity on both feature and label domains. Simulation study shows the improved
  performance of our model and a human eQTL data set is analyzed to further demonstrate
  the applications of the model.
