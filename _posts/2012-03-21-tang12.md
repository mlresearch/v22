title: Multiresolution Deep Belief Networks
abstract: Motivated by the observation that coarse and fine resolutions of an image
  reveal different structures in the underlying visual phenomenon, we present a model
  based on the Deep Belief Network (DBN) which learns features from the multiscale
  representation of images. A Laplacian Pyramid is first constructed for each image.
  DBNs are then trained separately at each level of the pyramid. Finally, a top level
  RBM combines these DBNs into a single network we call the Multiresolution Deep Belief
  Network (MrDBN). Experiments show that MrDBNs generalize better than standard DBNs
  on NORB classification and TIMIT phone recognition. In the domain of generative
  learning, we demonstrate the superiority of MrDBNs at modeling face images.
