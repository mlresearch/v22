title: Structured Output Learning with High Order Loss Functions
abstract: Often when modeling structured domains, it is desirable to leverage information
  that is not naturally expressed  as simply a label. Examples include   knowledge
  about the evaluation measure that will be used at test time, and partial  (weak)
  label information. When the additional information has structure that factorizes
  according to small subsets of variables (i.e., is \emphlow order, or \emphdecomposable),  several
  approaches can be used to incorporate it into a learning procedure.   Our focus
  in this work is the more challenging case, where the additional information does
  not factorize according to low order graphical model structure; we call this the
  \emphhigh order case. We propose to formalize various forms of this additional information
  as high order loss functions, which may have complex interactions over large subsets
  of variables. We then address the computational challenges inherent in learning
  according to such loss functions, particularly focusing on the loss-augmented inference
  problem that arises in large margin learning; we show that learning with high order
  loss functions is often practical, giving strong empirical results, with one popular
  and several novel high-order loss functions, in several settings.
