title: Sample Complexity of Composite Likelihood
abstract: We present the first PAC bounds for learning parameters of Conditional Random
  Fields (CRFs) with general structures over discrete and real-valued variables. Our
  bounds apply to composite likelihood, which generalizes maximum likelihood and pseudolikelihood.
  Moreover, we show that the only existing algorithm with a PAC bound for learning
  high-treewidth discrete models can be viewed as a computationally inefficient method
  for computing pseudolikelihood. We present an extensive empirical study of the statistical
  efficiency of these estimators, as predicted by our bounds. Finally, we use our
  bounds to show how to construct computationally and statistically efficient composite
  likelihood estimators.
