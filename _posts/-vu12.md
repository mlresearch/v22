title: Minimax Rates of Estimation for Sparse PCA in High Dimensions
abstract: We study sparse principal components analysis in the high-dimensional setting,
  where $p$ (the number of variables) can be much larger  than $n$ (the number of
  observations). We prove optimal minimax lower and upper bounds on the estimation
  error for the first leading eigenvector when it belongs to an $\ell_q$ ball for
  $q \in [0,1]$. Our bounds are tight in $p$ and $n$ for all $q \in [0, 1]$ over a
  wide class of distributions. The upper bound is obtained by analyzing  the performance
  of $\ell_q$-constrained PCA. In particular, our results provide convergence rates
  for $\ell_1$-constrained PCA. Our methods and arguments are also extendable to multi-dimensional
  subspace estimation.
