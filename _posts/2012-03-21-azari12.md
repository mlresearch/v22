title: Graphlet decomposition of a weighted network
abstract: We consider the problem of modeling networks with nonnegative edge weights.
  We develop a \emphbit-string decomposition (BSD) for weighted networks, a new representation
  of social information based on social structure, with an underlying semi-parametric
  statistical model.  We develop a scalable inference algorithm, which combines Expectation-Maximization
  with Bron-Kerbosch in a novel fashion, for estimating the modelâ€™s parameters from
  a network sample.  We present theoretical descriptions to the computational complexity
  of the method. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed methodology
  for synthetic data, academic networks from Facebook and finding communities in a
  historical data from 19th century.
