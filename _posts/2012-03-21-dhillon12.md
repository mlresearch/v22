title: Deterministic Annealing for Semi-Supervised Structured Output Learning
abstract: In this paper we propose a new approach for semi-supervised structured output
  learning. Our approach uses relaxed labeling on unlabeled data to deal with the
  combinatorial nature of the label space and further uses domain constraints to guide
  the learning.  Since the overall objective is non-convex, we alternate between the
  optimization of the model parameters and the label distribution of unlabeled data.
  The alternating optimization coupled with deterministic annealing helps us achieve
  better local optima and as a result our approach leads to better constraint satisfaction
  during inference. Experimental results on sequence labeling benchmarks show superior
  performance of our approach compared to Constraint Driven Learning (CoDL) and Posterior
  Regularization (PR).
