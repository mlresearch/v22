title: Data dependent kernels in nearly-linear time
abstract: We propose a method to efficiently construct data dependent kernels which
  can make use of large quantities of (unlabeled) data. Our construction makes an
  approximation in the standard construction of semi-supervised kernels in Sindhwani
  et al. (2005). In typical cases these kernels can be computed in nearly-linear time
  (in the amount of data), improving on the cubic time of the standard construction,
  enabling large scale semi-supervised learning in a variety of contexts. The methods
  are validated on semi-supervised and unsupervised problems on data sets containing
  upto 64,000 sample points.
