title: Sparse Higher-Order Principal Components Analysis
abstract: 'Traditional tensor decompositions such as the CANDECOMP / PARAFAC (CP)
  and Tucker decompositions yield higher-order principal components that have been
  used to understand tensor data in areas such as neuroimaging, microscopy, chemometrics,
  and remote sensing. Sparsity in high-dimensional matrix factorizations and principal
  components has been well-studied exhibiting many benefits; less attention has been
  given to sparsity in tensor decompositions. We propose two novel tensor decompositions
  that incorporate sparsity: the Sparse Higher-Order SVD and the Sparse CP Decomposition.
  The latter solves a 1-norm penalized relaxation of the single-factor CP optimization
  problem, thereby automatically selecting relevant features for each tensor factor.
  Through experiments and a scientific data analysis example, we demonstrate the utility
  of our methods for dimension reduction, feature selection, signal recovery, and
  exploratory data analysis of high-dimensional tensors.'
