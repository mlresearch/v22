title: 'Probabilistic acoustic tube: a probabilistic generative model of speech for
  speech analysis/synthesis'
abstract: Most speech analysis/synthesis systems are based on the basic physical model
  of speech production - the acoustic tube model. There are two main drawbacks with
  current speech analysis methods. First, a common design paradigm seems to build
  a special-purpose signal-processing front-end followed by (when appropriate) a back-end
  based on probabilistic models. A difficulty is that most features are nonlinear
  operators of the speech waveform, whose statistical behavior is hard to be modeled.
  Second, different tasks of speech analysis are carried out separately. These practices
  are admittedly useful but not optimal due to the incomplete use of available information.
  These examinations motivate us to directly model the spectrogram and to integrate
  together the three fundamental speech parameters - the pitch, energy and spectral
  envelope. We successfully devise such a model called probabilistic acoustic tube
  (PAT) model. The integration is performed in a principled manner with explicit physical
  meaning. We demonstrate the capability of PAT for a number of speech analysis/synthesis
  tasks, such as pitch tracking under both clean and additive noise conditions, speech
  synthesis, and phoneme clustering.
