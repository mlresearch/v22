title: Perturbation based Large Margin Approach for Ranking
abstract: 'The use of the standard hinge loss for structured outputs, for the learning
  to rank problem, faces two main caveats: (a) the label space, the set of all possible
  permutations of items to be ranked, is too large, and also less amenable to the
  usual dynamic-programming based techniques used for structured outputs, and (b)
  the supervision or training data consists of instances with multiple labels per
  input, instead of just a single label. The most natural way to deal with such multiple
  labels leads, unfortunately, to a non-convex surrogate. In this paper, we propose
  a general class of perturbation-based surrogates that leverage the large margin
  approach, and are convex. We show that the standard hinge surrogate for classification
  actually falls within this class. We also find a surrogate within this class, for
  the ranking problem, that does not suffer from the caveats mentioned above. Indeed,
  our experiments demonstrate that it performs better than other candidate large margin
  proposals on both synthetic and real world ranking datasets.'
