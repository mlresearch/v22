title: On Bisubmodular Maximization
abstract: Bisubmodularity extends the concept of submodularity to set functions with
  two arguments. We show how bisubmodular maximization leads to richer value-of-information
  problems, using examples in sensor placement and feature selection. We present the
  first constant-factor approximation algorithm for a wide class of bisubmodular maximizations.
