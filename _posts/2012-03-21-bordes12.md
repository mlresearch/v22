title: Joint Learning of Words and Meaning Representations for Open-Text Semantic
  Parsing
abstract: Open-text semantic parsers are designed to interpret any statement in natural
  language by inferring a corresponding meaning representation (MR - a formal representation
  of its sense). Unfortunately, large scale systems cannot be easily machine-learned
  due to lack of directly supervised data. We propose a method that learns to assign
  MRs to a wide range of text (using a dictionary of more than 70,000 words mapped
  to more than 40,000 entities) thanks to a training scheme that combines learning
  from knowledge bases (e.g. WordNet) with learning from raw text. The model jointly
  learns representations of words, entities and MRs via a multi-task training process
  operating on these diverse sources of data. Hence, the system ends up providing
  methods for knowledge acquisition and word-sense disambiguation within the context
  of semantic parsing in a single elegant framework. Experiments on these various
  tasks indicate the promise of the approach.
