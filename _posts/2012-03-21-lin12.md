title: Efficient Sampling from Combinatorial Space via Bridging
abstract: 'MCMC sampling has been extensively studied and used in probabilistic inference.
  Many algorithms rely on local updates to explore the space, often resulting in slow
  convergence or failure to mix when there is no path from one set of states to another
  via local changes. We propose an efficient method for sampling from combinatorial
  spaces that addresses these issues via “bridging states” that facilitate the communication
  between different parts of the space. Such states can be created dynamically, providing
  more flexibility than methods relying on specific space structures to design jump
  proposals. Theoretical analysis of the approach yields bounds on mixing times. Empirical
  analysis demonstrates the practical utility on two problems: constrained map labeling
  and inferring partial order of object layers in a video.'
