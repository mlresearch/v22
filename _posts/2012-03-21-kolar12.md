title: Marginal Regression For Multitask Learning
abstract: 'Variable selection is an important practical problem that arises in   analysis
  of many high-dimensional datasets. Convex optimization   procedures, that arise
  from relaxing the NP-hard subset selection   procedure, e.g., the Lasso or Dantzig
  selector, have become the   focus of intense theoretical investigations. Although
  many efficient   algorithms exist that solve these problems, finding a solution
  when   the number of variables is large, e.g., several hundreds of   thousands in
  problems arising in genome-wide association analysis,   is still computationally
  challenging. A practical solution for these   high-dimensional problems is the marginal
  regression, where the   output is regressed on each variable separately. We investigate   theoretical
  properties of the marginal regression in a multitask   framework. Our contribution
  include: i) sharp analysis for the   marginal regression in a single task setting
  with random design, ii)   sufficient conditions for the multitask screening to select
  the   relevant variables, iii) a lower bound on the Hamming distance   convergence
  for multitask variable selection problems. A simulation   study further demonstrates
  the performance of the marginal   regression.'
