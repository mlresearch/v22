title: Joint Estimation of Structured Sparsity and Output Structure in Multiple-Output
  Regression via Inverse-Covariance Regularization
abstract: We consider the problem of learning a sparse regression model for predicting
  multiple related outputs given high-dimensional inputs, where related outputs are
  likely to share common relevant inputs. Most of the previous methods for learning
  structured sparsity assumed that the structure over the outputs is known a priori,
  and focused on designing regularization functions that encourage structured sparsity
  reflecting the given output structure. In this paper, we propose a new approach
  for sparse multiple-output regression that can jointly learn both the output structure
  and regression coefficients with structured sparsity. Our approach reformulates
  the standard regression model into an alternative parameterization that leads to
  a conditional Gaussian graphical model, and employes an inverse-covariance regularization.
  We show that the orthant-wise quasi-Newton algorithm developed for L1-regularized
  log-linear model can be adopted for a fast optimization for our method. We demonstrate
  our method on simulated datasets and real datasets from genetics and finances applications.
