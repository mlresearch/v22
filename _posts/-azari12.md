title: Graphlet decomposition of a weighted network
abstract: We consider the problem of modeling networks with nonnegative edge weights.
  We develop a \emph{bit-string decomposition (BSD)} for weighted networks, a new
  representation of social information based on social structure, with an underlying
  semi-parametric statistical model.  We develop a scalable inference algorithm, which
  combines Expectation-Maximization with Bron-Kerbosch in a novel fashion, for estimating
  the model's parameters from a network sample.  We present theoretical descriptions
  to the computational complexity of the method. Finally, we demonstrate the performance
  of the proposed methodology for synthetic data, academic networks from Facebook
  and finding communities in a historical data from 19th century.
