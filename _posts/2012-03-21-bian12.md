title: 'CorrLog: Correlated Logistic Models for Joint Prediction of Multiple Labels'
abstract: In this paper, we present a simple but effective method for multi-label
  classification (MLC), termed Correlated Logistic Models (Corrlog), which extends
  multiple Independent Logistic Regressions (ILRs) by modeling the pairwise correlation
  between labels. Algorithmically, we propose an efficient method for learning parameters
  of Corrlog, which is based on regularized maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation and
  has a linear computational complexity with respect to the number of labels. Theoretically,
  we show that Corrlog enjoys a satisfying generalization bound which is independent
  of the number of labels. The effectiveness of Corrlog on modeling label correlations
  is illustrated by a toy example, and further experiments on real data show that
  Corrlog achieves competitive performance compared with popular MLC algorithms.
