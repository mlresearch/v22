title: Consistency and Rates for Clustering with DBSCAN
abstract: We propose a simple and efficient modification of the popular DBSCAN clustering
  algorithm. This modification is able to detect the most interesting vertical threshold
  level in an automated, data-driven way. We establish both consistency and optimal
  learning rates for this modification.
