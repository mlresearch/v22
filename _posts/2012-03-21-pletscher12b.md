title: Learning Low-order Models for Enforcing High-order Statistics
abstract: Models such as pairwise conditional random fields (CRFs) are extremely popular
  in computer vision and various other machine learning disciplines. However, they
  have limited expressive power and often cannot represent the posterior distribution
  correctly. While learning the parameters of such models which have insufficient
  expressivity, researchers use loss functions to penalize certain misrepresentations
  of the solution space. Till now, researchers have used only simplistic loss functions
  such as the hamming loss, to enable efficient inference. The paper shows how sophisticated
  and useful higher order loss functions can be incorporated in the learning process.
  These loss functions ensure that the MAP solution does not deviate much from the
  ground truth in terms of certain \emphhigher order statistics. We propose a learning
  algorithm which uses the recently proposed lower-envelope representation of higher
  order functions to transform them to pairwise functions, which allow efficient inference.
  We test the efficacy of our method on the problem of foreground-background image
  segmentation. Experimental results show that the incorporation of higher order loss
  functions in the learning formulation using our method leads to much better results
  compared to those obtained by using the traditional hamming loss.
