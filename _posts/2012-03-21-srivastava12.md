title: Testing for Membership to the IFRA and the NBU Classes of Distributions
abstract: This paper provides test procedures to determine whether the probability
  distribution underlying a set of non-negative valued samples belongs to the Increasing
  Failure Rate Average (IFRA) class or the New Better than Used (NBU) class. Membership
  of a distribution to one of these classes is known to have implications which are
  important in reliability, queuing theory, game theory and other disciplines. Our
  proposed test is based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between an empirical cumulative
  hazard function and its best approximation from the class of distributions constituting
  the null hypothesis. It turns out that the least favorable distribution, which produces
  the largest probability of Type I error of each of the tests, is the exponential
  distribution. This fact is used to produce an appropriate cut-off or p-value. Monte
  Carlo simulations are conducted to check small sample size (i.e., significance)
  and power of the test. Usefulness of the test is illustrated through the analysis
  of a set of monthly family expenditure data collected by the National Sample Survey
  Organization of the Government of India.
