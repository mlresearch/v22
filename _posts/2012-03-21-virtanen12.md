title: Bayesian Group Factor Analysis
abstract: We introduce a factor analysis model that summarizes the dependencies between
  observed variable groups, instead of dependencies between individual variables as
  standard factor analysis does. A group may correspond to one view of the same set
  of objects, one of many data sets tied by co-occurrence, or a set of alternative
  variables collected from statistics tables to measure one property of interest.
  We show that by assuming group-wise sparse factors, active in a subset of the sets,
  the variation can be decomposed into factors explaining relationships between the
  sets and factors explaining away set-specific variation. We formulate the assumptions
  in a Bayesian model providing the factors, and apply the model to two data analysis
  tasks, in neuroimaging and chemical systems biology.
