title: Bayesian Inference for Change Points in Dynamical Systems with Reusable States
  - a Chinese Restaurant Process Approach
abstract: We study a model of a stochastic process with unobserved parameters which
  suddenly change at random times. The possible parameter values are assumed to be
  from a finite but unknown set. Using a Chinese restaurant process prior over parameters
  we develop an efficient MCMC procedure for Bayesian inference. We demonstrate the
  significance of our approach with an application to systems biology data.
