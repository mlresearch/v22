title: Beta-Negative Binomial Process and Poisson Factor Analysis
abstract: A beta-negative binomial (BNB) process is proposed, leading to a beta-gamma-Poisson
  process, which may be viewed as a ``multi-scoop'' generalization of the beta-Bernoulli
  process. The BNB process is augmented into a beta-gamma-gamma-Poisson hierarchical
  structure, and applied as a nonparametric Bayesian prior for an infinite Poisson
  factor analysis model. A finite approximation for the beta process Levy random measure
  is constructed for convenient implementation. Efficient MCMC computations are performed
  with data augmentation and marginalization techniques. Encouraging results are shown
  on document count matrix factorization.
