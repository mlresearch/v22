title: Random Feature Maps for Dot Product Kernels
abstract: Approximating non-linear kernels using feature maps has gained a lot of
  interest in recent years due to applications in reducing training and testing times
  of SVM classifiers and other kernel based learning algorithms. We extend this line
  of work and present low distortion embeddings for dot product kernels into linear
  Euclidean spaces. We base our results on a classical result in harmonic analysis
  characterizing all dot product kernels and use it to define randomized feature maps
  into explicit low dimensional Euclidean spaces in which the native dot product provides
  an approximation to the dot product kernel with high confidence.
