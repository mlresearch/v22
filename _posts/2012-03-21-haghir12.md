title: Information Theoretic Model Validation for Spectral Clustering
abstract: 'Model validation constitutes a fundamental step in data clustering. The
  central question is: Which cluster model and how many clusters are most appropriate
  for a certain application? In this study, we introduce a method for the validation
  of spectral clustering based upon approximation set coding. In particular, we compare
  correlation and pairwise clustering to analyze the correlations of temporal gene
  expression profiles. To evaluate and select clustering models, we calculate their
  reliable informativeness. Experimental results in the context of gene expression
  analysis show that pairwise clustering yields superior amounts of reliable information.
  The analysis results are consistent with the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),
  and exhibit higher generality than BIC.'
