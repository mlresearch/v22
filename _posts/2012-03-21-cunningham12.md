title: Gaussian Processes for time-marked time-series data
abstract: In many settings, data is collected as multiple time series, where each
  recorded time series is an observation of some underlying dynamical process of interest.  These
  observations are often time-marked with known event times, and one desires to do
  a range of standard analyses.  When there is only one time marker, one simply aligns
  the observations temporally on that marker.  When multiple time-markers are present
  and are at different times on different time series observations, these analyses
  are more difficult.  We describe a Gaussian Process model for analyzing multiple
  time series with multiple time markings, and we test it on a variety of data.
