title: 'UPAL: Unbiased Pool Based Active Learning'
abstract: In this paper we address the problem of pool based active learning, and
  provide an algorithm, called UPAL, that works by minimizing the unbiased estimator
  of the risk of a hypothesis in a given hypothesis space. For the space of linear
  classifiers and the squared loss we show that UPAL is equivalent to an exponentially
  weighted average forecaster. Exploiting some recent results regarding the spectra
  of random matrices allows us to analyze UPAL with squared losses for the noiseless
  setting. Empirical comparison with an active learner implementation in Vowpal Wabbit,
  and a previously proposed pool based active learner implementation show good empirical
  performance and better scalability.
