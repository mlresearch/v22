title: An Autoregressive Approach to Nonparametric Hierarchical Dependent Modeling
abstract: We propose a conditional autoregression framework for a collection of random
  probability measures. Under this framework, we devise a conditional autoregressive
  Dirichlet process (DP) that we call one-parameter dependent DP (wDDP). The appealing
  properties of this specification are that it has two equivalent representations
  and its inference can be implemented in a conditional Polya urn scheme. Moreover,
  these two representations bear a resemblance to the Polya urn scheme and the stick-breaking
  representation in the conventional DP. We apply this wDDP to Bayesian multivariate-response
  regression problems. An efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed
  for Bayesian computation and prediction.
