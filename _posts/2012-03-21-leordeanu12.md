title: Efficient Hypergraph Clustering
abstract: Data clustering is an essential problem in data mining, machine learning
  and computer vision. In this paper we present a novel method for the hypergraph
  clustering problem, in which second or higher order affinities between sets of data
  points are considered. Our algorithm has important theoretical properties, such
  as convergence and satisfaction of first order necessary optimality conditions.
  It is based on an efficient iterative procedure, which by updating the cluster membership
  of all points in parallel, is able to achieve state of the art results in very few
  steps. We outperform current hypergraph clustering methods especially in terms of
  computational speed, but also in terms of accuracy. Moreover, we show that our method
  could be successfully applied both to higher-order assignment problems and to image
  segmentation.
