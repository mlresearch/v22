title: Online Clustering of Processes
abstract: The problem of online clustering is considered in the case where each data
  point is a sequence generated by a stationary ergodic process. Data arrive in an
  online fashion so that the sample received at every time-step is either a continuation
  of some previously received sequence or a new sequence. The dependence between the
  sequences can be arbitrary. No parametric or independence assumptions are made;
  the only assumption is that the marginal distribution of each sequence is stationary
  and ergodic. A novel, computationally efficient algorithm is proposed and is shown
  to be asymptotically consistent (under a natural notion of consistency). The performance
  of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on simulated data,  as well as on real datasets
  (motion classification).
