title: Lightning-speed Structure Learning of Nonlinear Continuous Networks
abstract: Graphical models are widely used to reason about high-dimensional domains.
  Yet, learning the structure of the model from data remains a formidable challenge,
  particularly in complex continuous domains. We present a highly accelerated structure
  learning approach for continuous densities based on the recently introduced copula
  Bayesian network representation. For two common copula families, we prove that the
  expected likelihood of a building block edge in the model is monotonic in Spearmanâ€™s
  rank correlation measure. We also show numerically that the same relationship holds
  for many other copula families. This allows us to perform structure learning while
  bypassing costly parameter estimation as well as explicit computation of the log-likelihood
  function.  We demonstrate the merit of our approach for structure learning in three
  varied real-life domains.  Importantly, the computational benefits are such that
  they open the door for practical scaling-up of structure learning in complex nonlinear
  continuous domains.
