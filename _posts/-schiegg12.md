title: 'Markov Logic Mixtures of Gaussian Processes: Towards Machines Reading Regression
  Data'
abstract: We propose a novel mixtures of Gaussian processes model in which the gating
  function is interconnected with a probabilistic logical model, in our case Markov
  logic networks. In this way, the resulting mixed graphical model, called Markov
  logic mixtures of Gaussian processes (MLxGP), solves joint Bayesian non-parametric
  regression and probabilistic relational inference tasks. In turn, MLxGP facilitates
  novel, interesting tasks such as regression based on logical constraints or drawing
  probabilistic logical conclusions about regression data, thus putting ``machines
  reading regression data'' in reach.
