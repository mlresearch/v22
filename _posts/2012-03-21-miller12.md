title: Max-Margin Min-Entropy Models
abstract: 'We propose a new family of latent variable models called max-margin min-entropy
  (M3E) models, which define a distribution over the output and the hidden variables
  conditioned on the input. Given an input, an M3E model predicts the output with
  the smallest corresponding Renyi entropy of generalized distribution. This is equivalent
  to minimizing a score that consists of two terms: (i) the negative log-likelihood
  of the output, ensuring that the output has a high probability; and (ii) a measure
  of uncertainty over the distribution of the hidden variables conditioned on the
  input and the output, ensuring that there is little confusion in the values of the
  hidden variables. Given a training dataset, the parameters of an M3E model are learned
  by maximizing the margin between the Renyi entropies of the ground-truth output
  and all other incorrect outputs. Training an M3E can be viewed as minimizing an
  upper bound on a user-defined loss, and includes, as a special case, the latent
  support vector machine framework. We demonstrate the efficacy of M3E models on two
  standard machine learning applications, discriminative motif finding and image classification,
  using publicly available datasets.'
