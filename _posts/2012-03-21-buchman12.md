title: On Sparse, Spectral and Other Parameterizations of Binary Probabilistic Models
abstract: This paper studies issues relating to the parameterization of probability
  distributions over binary data sets.  Several such parameterizations of models for
  binary data are known, including the Ising, generalized Ising, canonical and full
  parameterizations.  We also discuss a parameterization that we call the “spectral
  parameterization”, which has received significantly less coverage in existing literature.  We
  provide this parameterization with a spectral interpretation by casting log-linear
  models in terms of orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard harmonic expansions.  Using various
  standard and group sparse regularizers for structural learning, we provide a comprehensive
  theoretical and empirical comparison of these parameterizations.  We show that the
  spectral parameterization, along with the canonical, has the best performance and
  sparsity levels, while the spectral does not depend on any particular reference
  state.  The spectral interpretation also provides a new starting point for analyzing
  the statistics of binary data sets; we measure the magnitude of higher order interactions
  in the underlying distributions for several data sets.
