title: Infinite-Dimensional Kalman Filtering Approach to Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
  Process Regression
abstract: We show how spatio-temporal Gaussian process (GP) regression problems (or
  the equivalent Kriging problems) can be formulated as infinite-dimensional Kalman
  filtering and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing problems, and present a procedure
  for converting spatio-temporal covariance functions into infinite-dimensional stochastic
  differential equations (SDEs). The resulting infinite-dimensional SDEs belong to
  the class of stochastic pseudo-differential equations and can be numerically treated
  using the methods developed for deterministic counterparts of the equations. The
  scaling of the computational cost in the proposed approach is linear in the number
  of time steps as opposed to the cubic scaling of the direct GP regression solution.
  We also show how separable covariance functions lead to a finite-dimensional Kalman
  filtering and RTS smoothing problem, present analytical and numerical examples,
  and discuss numerical methods for computing the solutions.
