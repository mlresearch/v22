title: Variable Selection for Gaussian Graphical Models
abstract: 'We present a variable-selection structure learning approach for Gaussian
  graphical models. Unlike standard sparseness promoting techniques, our method aims
  at selecting the most-important variables besides simply sparsifying the set of
  edges. Through simulations, we show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
  in recovering the ground truth model. Our method also exhibits better generalization
  performance in a wide range of complex real-world datasets: brain fMRI, gene expression,
  NASDAQ stock prices and world weather. We also show that our resulting networks
  are more interpretable in the context of brain fMRI analysis, while retaining discriminability.
  From an optimization perspective, we show that a block coordinate descent method
  generates a sequence of positive definite solutions. Thus, we reduce the original
  problem into a sequence of strictly convex (\ell_1,\ell_p) regularized quadratic
  minimization subproblems for p∈{2,∞}. Our algorithm is well founded since the optimal
  solution of the maximization problem is unique and bounded.'
