title: A Bayesian Analysis of the Radioactive Releases of Fukushima
abstract: The Fukushima Daiichi disaster 11 March, 2011 is considered the largest
  nuclear accident since the 1986 Chernobyl disaster and has been rated at level 7
  on the International Nuclear Event Scale. As different radioactive materials have
  different effects to human body, it is important to know the types of nuclides and
  their levels of concentration from the recorded mixture of radiations to well take
  necessary measures. We presently formulate a Bayesian generative model for the data
  available on radioactive releases from the Fukushima Daiichi disaster across Japan.
  The model can infer from the sparsely sampled measurements what nuclides are present
  as well as their concentration levels. An important property of the proposed model
  is that it admits unique recovery of the parameters. On synthetic data we demonstrate
  that our model is able to infer the underlying components and on data from the Fukushima
  Daiichi plant we establish that the model is able to well account for the data.
  We further demonstrate how the model extends to include all the available measurements
  recorded throughout Japan. The model can be considered a first attempt to apply
  Bayesian learning unsupervised in order to give a more detailed account also of
  the latent structure present in the data of the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.
