title: Fast Variational Mode-Seeking
abstract: 'Mode-seeking algorithms (e.g., mean-shift) constitute a class of powerful
  non-parametric clustering methods, but they are slow. We present VMS, a dual-tree
  based variational EM framework for mode-seeking that greatly accelerates performance.
  VMS has a number of pleasing properties: it generalizes across different mode-seeking
  algorithms, it does not have typical homoscedasticity constraints on kernel bandwidths,
  and it is the first truly sub-quadratic acceleration method that maintains provable
  convergence for a well-defined objective function. Experimental results demonstrate
  acceleration benefits over competing methods and show that VMS is particularly desirable
  for data sets of massive size, where a coarser approximation is needed to improve
  the computational efficiency.'
