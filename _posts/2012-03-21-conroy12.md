title: Fast, Exact Model Selection and Permutation Testing for l2-Regularized Logistic
  Regression
abstract: Regularized logistic regression is a standard classification method used
  in statistics and machine learning. Unlike regularized least squares problems such
  as ridge regression, the parameter estimates cannot be computed in closed-form and
  instead must be estimated using an iterative technique. This paper addresses the
  computational problem of regularized logistic regression that is commonly encountered
  in model selection and classifier statistical significance testing, in which a large
  number of related logistic regression problems must be solved for. Our proposed
  approach solves the problems simultaneously through an iterative technique, which
  also garners computational efficiencies by leveraging the redundancies across the
  related problems. We demonstrate analytically that our method provides a substantial
  complexity reduction, which is further validated by our results on real-world datasets.
