title: Regularization Paths with Guarantees for Convex Semidefinite Optimization
abstract: We devise a simple algorithm for computing an approximate solution path
  for parameterized semidefinite convex optimization problems that is guaranteed to
  be epsilon-close to the exact solution path.  As a consequence, we can compute the
  entire regularization path for many regularized matrix completion and factorization
  approaches, as well as nuclear norm or weighted nuclear norm regularized convex
  optimization problems.  This also includes robust PCA and variants of sparse PCA.  On
  the theoretical side, we show that the approximate solution path has low complexity.
  This implies that the whole solution path can be computed efficiently. Our experiments
  demonstrate the practicality of the approach for large matrix completion problems.
