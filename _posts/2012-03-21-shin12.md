title: Complexity of Bethe Approximation
abstract: 'This paper resolves a common complexity issue in the Bethe approximation
  of statistical physics and the sum-product Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm of
  artificial intelligence. The Bethe approximation reduces the problem of computing
  the partition function in a graphical model to that of solving a set of non-linear
  equations, so-called the Bethe equation. On the other hand, the BP algorithm is
  a popular heuristic method for estimating marginal distribution in a graphical model.
  Although they are inspired and developed from different directions, Yedidia, Freeman
  and Weiss (2004) established a somewhat surprising connection: the BP algorithm
  solves the Bethe equation if it converges (however, it often does not). This naturally
  motivates the following important question to understand their limitations and empirical
  successes: the Bethe equation is computationally easy to solve? We present a message
  passing algorithm solving the Bethe equation in polynomial number of bitwise operations
  for arbitrary binary graphical models of n nodes where the maximum degree in the
  underlying graph is O(log n). Our algorithm, an alternative to BP fixing its convergence
  issue, is the first fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the BP fixed
  point computation in such a large class of graphical models. Moreover, we believe
  that our technique is of broader interest to understand the computational complexity
  of the cavity method in statistical physics.'
