title: Constrained 1-Spectral Clustering
abstract: An important form of prior information in clustering comes in the form of
  cannot-link and must-link constraints of instances. We present a generalization
  of the popular spectral clustering technique which integrates such constraints.
  Motivated by the recently proposed 1-spectral clustering for the unconstrained normalized
  cut problem, our method  is based on a tight relaxation of the constrained normalized
  cut into a continuous optimization problem.   Opposite to all other methods which
  have been suggested for constrained spectral clustering, we can always guarantee
  to satisfy all constraints. Moreover, our soft formulation allows to optimize a
  trade-off between normalized cut and  the number of violated constraints. An efficient
  implementation is provided which scales to large datasets. We outperform consistently
  all other proposed methods in the experiments.
