title: Exchangeability Characterizes Optimality of Sequential Normalized Maximum Likelihood
  and Bayesian Prediction with Jeffreys Prior
abstract: 'We study online prediction of individual sequences under logarithmic loss
  with parametric constant experts. The optimal strategy, normalized maximum likelihood
  (NML), is computationally demanding and requires the length of the game to be known.
  We consider two simpler strategies: sequential normalized maximum likelihood (SNML),
  which computes the NML forecasts at each round as if it were the last round, and
  Bayesian prediction. Under appropriate conditions, both are known to achieve near-optimal
  regret.  In this paper, we investigate when these strategies are optimal. We show
  that SNML is optimal iff the joint distribution on sequences defined by SNML is
  exchangeable. In the case of exponential families, this is equivalent to the optimality
  of any Bayesian prediction strategy, and the optimal prior is Jeffreys prior.'
