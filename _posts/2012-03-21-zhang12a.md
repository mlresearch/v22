title: Efficient Distributed Linear Classification Algorithms via the Alternating
  Direction Method of Multipliers
abstract: Linear classification has demonstrated success in many areas of applications.
  Modern algorithms for linear classification can train reasonably good models while
  going through the data in only tens of rounds. However, large data often does not
  fit in the memory of a single machine, which makes the bottleneck in large-scale
  learning the disk I/O, not the CPU. Following this observation, Yu et al. (2010)
  made significant progress in reducing disk usage, and their algorithms now outperform
  LIBLINEAR. In this paper, rather than optimizing algorithms on a single machine,
  we propose and implement distributed algorithms that achieve parallel disk loading
  and access the disk only once. Our large-scale learning algorithms are based on
  the framework of alternating direction methods of multipliers. The framework derives
  a subproblem that remains to be solved efficiently for which we propose using dual
  coordinate descent. Our experimental evaluations on large datasets demonstrate that
  the proposed algorithms achieve significant speedup over the classifier proposed
  by Yu et al. running on a single machine. Our algorithms are faster than existing
  distributed solvers, such as Zinkevich et al. (2010)â€™s parallel stochastic gradient
  descent and Vowpal Wabbit.
