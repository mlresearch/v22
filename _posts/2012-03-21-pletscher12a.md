title: 'Part & Clamp: Efficient Structured Output Learning'
abstract: Discriminative training for general graphical models is a challenging task,
  due to the intractability of the partition function. We propose a computationally
  efficient approach to estimate the partition sum in a structured learning problem.
  The key idea is a lower bound of the partition sum that can be evaluated in a fixed
  number of message passing iterations. The bound makes use of a subset of the variables,
  a feedback vertex set, which allows us to decompose the graph into tractable parts.
  Furthermore, a tightening strategy for the bound is presented, which finds the states
  of the feedback vertex set that maximally increase the bound, and clamps them. Based
  on this lower bound we derive batch and online learning algorithms and demonstrate
  their effectiveness on a computer vision problem.
