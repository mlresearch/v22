title: Minimax hypothesis testing for curve registration
abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of goodness-of-fit for curve registration,
  and more precisely for the shifted curve model, whose application field reaches
  from computer vision and road trafic prediction to medicine. We give bounds for
  the asymptotic minimax separation rate, when the functions in the alternative lie
  in Sobolev balls and the separation from the null hypothesis is measured by the
  l2-norm. We use the generalized likelihood ratio to build a nonadaptive procedure
  depending on a tuning parameter, which we choose in an optimal way according to
  the smoothness of the ambient space. Then, a Bonferroni procedure is applied to
  give an adaptive test over a range of Sobolev balls. Both achieve the asymptotic
  minimax separation rates, up to possible logarithmic factors.
