title: Hierarchical Latent Dictionaries for Models of Brain Activation
abstract: In this work, we propose a hierarchical latent dictionary approach to estimate
  the time-varying mean and covariance of a process for which we have only limited
  noisy samples.  We fully leverage the limited sample size and redundancy in sensor
  measurements by transferring knowledge through a hierarchy of lower dimensional
  latent processes.   As a case study, we utilize Magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings
  of brain activity to identify the word being viewed by a human subject.  Specifically,
  we identify the word category for a single noisy MEG recording, when given only
  limited noisy samples on which to train.
