title: Multi-label Subspace Ensemble
abstract: A challenging problem of multi-label learning is that both the label space
  and the model complexity will grow rapidly with the increase in the number of labels,
  and thus makes the available training samples insufficient for training a proper
  model. In this paper, we eliminate this problem by learning a mapping of each label
  in the feature space as a robust subspace, and formulating the prediction as finding
  the group sparse representation of a given instance on the subspace ensemble. We
  term this approach as ``multi-label subspace ensemble (MSE)''. In the training stage,
  the data matrix is decomposed as the sum of several low-rank matrices and a sparse
  residual via a randomized optimization, where each low-rank part defines a subspace
  mapped by a label. In the prediction stage, the group sparse representation on the
  subspace ensemble is estimated by group lasso. Experiments on several benchmark
  datasets demonstrate the appealing performance of MSE.
