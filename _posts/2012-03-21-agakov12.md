title: Discriminative Mixtures of Sparse Latent Fields for Risk Management
abstract: We describe a simple and efficient approach to learning structures of sparse
  high-dimensional latent variable models. Standard algorithms either learn structures
  of specific predefined forms, or estimate sparse graphs in the data space ignoring
  the possibility of the latent variables. In contrast, our method learns rich dependencies
  and allows for latent variables that may confound the relations between the observations.
  We extend the model to conditional mixtures with side information and non-Gaussian
  marginal distributions of the observations. We then show that our model may be used
  for learning sparse latent variable structures corresponding to multiple unknown
  states, and for uncovering features useful for explaining and predicting structural
  changes. We apply the model to real-world financial data with heavy-tailed marginals
  covering the low- and high- market volatility periods of 2005-2011. We show that
  our method tends to give rise to significantly higher likelihoods of test data than
  standard network learning methods exploiting the sparsity assumption. We also demonstrate
  that our approach may be practical for financial stress testing and visualization
  of dependencies between financial instruments.
