title: Factorized Asymptotic Bayesian Inference for Mixture Modeling
abstract: 'This paper proposes a novel Bayesian approximation inference method for
  mixture modeling. Our key idea is to factorize marginal log-likelihood using a variational
  distribution over latent variables. An asymptotic approximation, a factorized information
  criterion (FIC), is obtained by applying the Laplace method to each of the factorized
  components. In order to evaluate FIC, we propose factorized asymptotic Bayesian
  inference (FAB), which maximizes an asymptotically-consistent lower bound of FIC.
  FIC and FAB have several desirable properties: 1) asymptotic consistency with the
  marginal log-likelihood, 2) automatic component selection on the basis of an intrinsic
  shrinkage mechanism, and 3) parameter identifiability in mixture modeling. Experimental
  results show that FAB outperforms state-of-the-art VB methods.'
