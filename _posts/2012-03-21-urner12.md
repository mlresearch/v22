title: Learning from Weak Teachers
abstract: This paper addresses the problem of learning when high-quality labeled examples
  are an expensive resource, while samples with error-prone labeling (for example
  generated by crowdsourcing) are readily available. We introduce a formal framework
  for such learning scenarios with label sources of varying quality, and we propose
  a parametric model for such label sources (``weak teachers''), reflecting the intuition
  that their labeling is likely to be correct in label-homogeneous regions but may
  deteriorate near classification boundaries. We consider learning when the learner
  has access to weakly labeled random samples and, on top of that, can actively query
  the correct labels of sample points of its choice. We propose a learning algorithm
  for this scenario, analyze its sample complexity and prove that, under certain conditions
  on the underlying data distribution, our learner can utilize the weak labels to
  reduce the number of expert labels it requires. We view this paper as a first step
  towards the development of a theory of learning from labels generated by teachers
  of varying accuracy, a scenario that is relevant in various practical applications.
