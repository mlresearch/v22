title: Factorized Diffusion Map Approximation
abstract: Diffusion maps are among the most powerful Machine Learning tools to analyze
  and work with complex high-dimensional datasets. Unfortunately, the estimation of
  these maps from a finite sample is known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality.
  Motivated by other machine learning models for which   the existence of structure
  in the underlying distribution of data can reduce the complexity of estimation,
  we study and show how the factorization of the underlying  distribution into independent
  subspaces can help us to estimate diffusion maps more accurately. Building upon
  this result, we propose and develop  an algorithm that can automatically factorize
  a high dimensional data space in order to  minimize the error of estimation of its
  diffusion map, even in the case when the underlying distribution is not decomposable.
  Experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved estimation
  performance of our method over  the regular diffusion-map framework.
