title: Minimax rates for homology inference
abstract: Often, high dimensional data lie close to a low-dimensional submanifold
  and it is of interest to understand the geometry of these submanifolds. The homology
  groups of a (sub)manifold are important topological invariants that provide an algebraic
  summary of the manifold. These groups contain rich topological information, for
  instance, about the connected components, holes, tunnels and (sometimes) the dimension
  of the manifold. In this paper, we consider the statistical problem of estimating
  the homology of a manifold from noisy samples under several different noise models.
  We derive upper and lower bounds on the minimax risk for this problem. Our upper
  bounds are based on estimators which are constructed from a union of balls of appropriate
  radius around carefully selected sample points. In each case we establish complementary
  lower bounds using Le Camâ€™s lemma.
