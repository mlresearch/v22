title: High-Dimensional Structured Feature Screening Using Binary Markov Random Fields
abstract: Feature screening is a useful feature selection approach for high-dimensional
  data when the goal is to identify all the features relevant to the response variable.
  However, common feature screening methods do not take into account the correlation
  structure of the covariate space. We propose the concept of a feature relevance
  network, a binary Markov random field to represent the relevance of each individual
  feature by potentials on the nodes, and represent the correlation structure by potentials
  on the edges. By performing inference on the feature relevance network, we can accordingly
  select relevant features. Our algorithm does not yield sparsity, which is different
  from the particular popular family of feature selection approaches based on penalized
  least squares or penalized pseudo-likelihood.  We give one concrete algorithm under
  this framework and show its superior performance over common feature selection methods
  in terms of prediction error and recovery of the truly relevant features on real-world
  data and synthetic data.
