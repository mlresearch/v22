title: Transductive Learning of Structural SVMs via Prior Knowledge Constraints
abstract: Reducing the number of labeled examples required to learn accurate prediction
  models is an important problem in structured output prediction. In this paper we
  propose a new transductive structural SVM algorithm that learns by incorporating
  prior knowledge constraints on unlabeled data.  Our formulation supports different
  types of prior knowledge constraints, and can be trained efficiently. Experiments
  on two citation and advertisement segmentation tasks show that our transductive
  structural SVM can learn effectively from unlabeled data, achieving similar prediction
  accuracies when compared against other state-of-art algorithms.
