title: Movement Segmentation and Recognition for Imitation Learning
abstract: In human movement learning, it is most common to teach constituent elements
  of complex movements in isolation, before chaining them into complex movements.
  Segmentation and recognition of observed movement could thus proceed out of this
  existing knowledge, which is directly compatible with movement generation. In this
  paper, we address exactly this scenario. We assume that a library of movement primitives
  has already been taught, and we wish to identify elements of the library in a complex
  motor act, where the individual elements have been smoothed together, and, occasionally,
  there might be a movement segment that is not in our library yet. We employ a flexible
  machine learning representation of movement primitives based on learnable nonlinear
  attractor system. For the purpose of movement segmentation and recognition, it is
  possible to reformulate this representation as a controlled linear dynamical system.  An
  Expectation-Maximization algorithm can be developed to estimate the open parameters
  of a movement primitive from the library, using as input an observed trajectory
  piece. If no matching primitive from the library can be found, a new primitive is
  created. This process allows a straightforward sequential segmentation of observed
  movement into known and new primitives, which are suitable for robot imitation learning.
  We illustrate our approach with synthetic examples and data collected from human
  movement.
