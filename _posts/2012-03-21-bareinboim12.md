title: Controlling Selection Bias in Causal Inference
abstract: Selection bias, caused by preferential exclusion of samples from the data,
  is a major obstacle to valid causal and statistical inferences; it cannot be removed
  by randomized experiments and can hardly be detected  in either experimental or
  observational studies. This paper highlights several graphical and algebraic methods
  capable of mitigating and sometimes eliminating this bias. These nonparametric methods
  generalize previously reported results, and identify the type of knowledge that
  is needed for reasoning in the presence of selection bias.  Specifically,  we derive
  a general condition together with a procedure for  deciding recoverability of the
  odds ratio (OR) from s-biased data. We show that recoverability  is feasible if
  and only if our condition holds.  We further offer a new method of controlling selection
  bias using instrumental variables that permits the  recovery of other effect measures
  besides OR.
