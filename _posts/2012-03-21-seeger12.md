title: Fast Variational Bayesian Inference for Non-Conjugate Matrix Factorization
  Models
abstract: Probabilistic matrix factorization methods aim to extract meaningful correlation
  structure from an incomplete data matrix by postulating low rank constraints. Recently,
  variational Bayesian (VB) inference techniques have successfully been applied to
  such large scale bilinear models. However, current algorithms are of the alternate
  updating or stochastic gradient descent type, slow to converge and prone to getting
  stuck in shallow local minima. While for MAP or maximum margin estimation, singular
  value shrinkage algorithms have been proposed which can far outperform alternate
  updating, this methodological avenue remains unexplored for Bayesian techniques.
  In this paper, we show how to combine a recent singular value shrinkage characterization
  of fully observed spherical Gaussian VB matrix factorization with augmented Lagrangian
  techniques in order to obtain efficient VB inference for general MF models with
  arbitrary likelihood potentials. In particular, we show how to handle Poisson and
  Bernoulli potentials, far more suited for most MF applications than Gaussian likelihoods.
  Our algorithm can be run even for very large models and is easily implemented in
  \em Matlab. It outperforms MAP estimation on a range of real-world datasets.
