title: High-Rank Matrix Completion
abstract: This paper considers the problem of completing a matrix with many missing
  entries under the assumption that the columns of the matrix belong to a union of
  multiple low-rank subspaces. This generalizes the standard low-rank matrix completion
  problem to situations in which the matrix rank can be quite high or even full rank.  Since
  the columns belong to a union of subspaces, this problem may also be viewed as a
  missing-data version of the subspace clustering problem.  Let X be an nxN matrix
  whose (complete) columns lie in a union of at most k subspaces, each of rank = r  n,
  and assume Nkn. The main result of the paper shows that under mild assumptions each
  column of X can be perfectly recovered with high probability from an incomplete
  version so long as at least C r N \log^2(n) entries of X are observed uniformly
  at random, with C1 a constant depending on the usual incoherence conditions, the
  geometrical arrangement of subspaces, and the distribution of columns over the subspaces.
  The result is illustrated with numerical experiments and an application to Internet
  distance matrix completion and topology identification.
