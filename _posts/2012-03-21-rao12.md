title: Universal Measurement Bounds for Structured Sparse Signal Recovery
abstract: Standard compressive sensing results state that to exactly recover an s
  sparse signal in Rp, one requires O(s log p) measurements. While this bound is extremely
  useful in practice, often real world signals are not only sparse, but also exhibit
  structure in the sparsity pattern. We focus on group-structured patterns in this
  paper. Under this model, groups of signal coefficients are active (or inactive)
  together. The groups are prede- fined, but the particular set of groups that are
  active (i.e., in the signal support) must be learned from measurements. We show
  that exploiting knowledge of groups can further reduce the number of measurements
  required for exact signal recovery, and derive universal bounds for the number of
  measurements needed. The bound is universal in the sense that it only depends on
  the number of groups under consideration, and not the particulars of the groups
  (e.g., compositions, sizes, ex- tents, overlaps, etc.). Experiments show that our
  result holds for a variety of overlapping group configurations.
