title: Adaptive MCMC with Bayesian Optimization
abstract: This paper proposes a new randomized strategy for adaptive MCMC using Bayesian
  optimization. This approach applies to non-differentiable objective functions and
  trades off exploration and exploitation to reduce the number of potentially costly
  objective function evaluations. We demonstrate the strategy in the complex setting
  of sampling from constrained, discrete and densely connected probabilistic graphical
  models where, for each variation of the problem, one needs to adjust the parameters
  of the proposal mechanism automatically to ensure efficient mixing of the Markov
  chains.
