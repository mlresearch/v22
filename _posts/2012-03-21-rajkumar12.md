title: A Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm for Multiparty
  Classification
abstract: We consider the problem of developing privacy preserving machine learning
  algorithms in a distributed multiparty setting. Here different parties own different
  parts of a data set, and the goal is to learn a classifier from the entire data
  set without any party revealing any information about the individual data points
  it owns. Pathak et al (2010) recently proposed a solution to this problem in which
  each party learns a local classifier from its own data, and a third party then aggregates
  these classifiers in a privacy-preserving manner using a cryptographic scheme. The
  generalization performance of their algorithm is sensitive to the number of parties
  and the relative fractions of data owned by the different parties. In this paper,
  we describe a new differentially private algorithm for the multiparty setting that
  uses a stochastic gradient descent based procedure to directly optimize the overall
  multiparty objective rather than combining classifiers learned from optimizing local
  objectives. The algorithm achieves a slightly weaker form of differential privacy
  than that of Pathak et al (2010), but provides improved generalization guarantees
  that do not depend on the number of parties or the relative sizes of the individual
  data sets. Experimental results corroborate our theoretical findings.
