title: Bayesian regularization of non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks by globally
  coupling interaction parameters
abstract: To relax the homogeneity assumption of classical dynamic Bayesian networks
  (DBNs), various recent studies have combined DBNs with multiple changepoint processes.
  The underlying assumption is that the parameters associated with time series segments
  delimited by multiple changepoints are a priori independent. Under weak regularity
  conditions, the parameters can be integrated out in the likelihood, leading to a
  closed-form expression of the marginal likelihood. However, the assumption of prior
  independence is unrealistic in many real-world applications, where the segment-specific
  regulatory relationships among the interdependent quantities tend to undergo gradual
  evolutionary adaptations. We therefore propose a Bayesian coupling scheme to introduce
  systematic information sharing among the segment-specific interaction parameters.
  We investigate the effect this model improvement has on the network reconstruction
  accuracy in a reverse engineering context, where the objective is to learn the structure
  of a gene regulatory network from temporal gene expression profiles.
