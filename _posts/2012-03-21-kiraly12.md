title: Regression for sets of polynomial equations
abstract: We propose a method called ideal regression for approximating an arbitrary
  system of polynomial equations by a system of a particular type. Using techniques
  from approximate computational algebraic geometry, we show how we can solve ideal
  regression directly without resorting to numerical optimization. Ideal regression
  is useful whenever the solution to a learning problem can be described by a system
  of polynomial equations. As an example, we demonstrate how to formulate Stationary
  Subspace Analysis (SSA), a source separation problem, in terms of ideal regression,
  which also yields a consistent estimator for SSA. We then compare this estimator
  in simulations with previous optimization-based approaches for SSA.
