title: Globally Optimizing Graph Partitioning Problems Using Message Passing
abstract: Graph partitioning algorithms play a central role in data analysis and machine
  learning. Most useful graph partitioning criteria correspond to optimizing a ratio
  between the cut and the size of the partitions, this ratio leads to an NP-hard problem
  that is only solved approximately. This makes it difficult to know whether failures
  of the algorithm are due to failures of the optimization or to the criterion being
  optimized. In this paper we present a framework that seeks and finds the optimal
  solution of several NP-hard graph partitioning problems. We use a classical approach
  to ratio problems where we repeatedly ask whether the optimal solution is greater
  than or less than some constant - lambda. Our main insight is the equivalence between
  this “lambda  question” and performing inference in a graphical model with many
  local potentials and one high-order potential. We show that this specific form of
  the high-order potential is amenable to message-passing algorithms and how to obtain
  a bound on the optimal solution from the messages. Our experiments show that in
  many cases our approach yields the global optimum and improves the popular spectral
  solution.
