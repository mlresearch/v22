title: Statistical test for consistent estimation of causal effects in linear non-Gaussian
  models
abstract: 'In many fields of science researchers are faced with the problem of estimating
  causal effects from non-experimental data. A key issue is to avoid inconsistent
  estimators due to confounding by measured or unmeasured covariates, a problem commonly
  solved by ’adjusting for’ a subset of the observed variables. When the data generating
  process can be represented by a directed acyclic graph, and this graph structure
  is known, there exist simple graphical procedures for determining which subset of
  covariates should be adjusted for to obtain consistent estimators of the causal
  effects. However, when the graph is not known no general and complete procedures
  for this task are available. In this paper we introduce such a method for linear
  non-Gaussian models, requiring only partial knowledge about the temporal ordering
  of the variables: We provide a simple statistical test for inferring whether an
  estimator of a causal effect is consistent when controlling for a subset of measured
  covariates, and we present heuristics to search for such a set. We show empirically
  that this statistical test identifies consistent vs inconsistent estimates, and
  that the search heuristics outperform the naive approach of adjusting for all observed
  covariates.'
