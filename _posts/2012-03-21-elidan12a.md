title: Copula Network Classifiers (CNCs)
abstract: The task of classification is of paramount importance and extensive research
  has been aimed at developing general purpose classifiers that can be used effectively
  in a variety of  domains. Network-based classifiers, such as the tree augmented
  naive Bayes model, are  appealing since they are easily interpretable, can naturally
  handle missing data, and are often quite effective. Yet, for complex domains with
  continuous explanatory variables, practical performance is often sub-optimal. To
  overcome this limitation, we introduce Copula Network Classifiers (CNCs), a model
  that combines the flexibility of a graph based representation with the modeling
  power of copulas. As we  demonstrate on ten varied continuous real-life datasets,
  CNCs offer better overall performance than linear and non-linear standard generative
  models, as well as discriminative RBF and polynomial kernel SVMs. In addition, since
  no parameter tuning is required, CNCs can be trained dramatically faster than SVMs.
