title: On a Connection between Maximum Variance Unfolding, Shortest Path Problems
  and IsoMap
abstract: We present an equivalent formulation of the Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU)
  problem in terms of distance matrices. This yields a novel interpretation of the
  MVU problem as a regularized version of the shortest path problem on a graph. This
  interpretation enables us to establish an asymptotic convergence result for the
  case that the underlying data are drawn from a Riemannian manifold which is isometric
  to a convex subset of Euclidean space.
