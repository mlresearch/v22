title: A Nonparametric Bayesian Model for Multiple Clustering with Overlapping Feature
  Views
abstract: Most clustering algorithms produce a single clustering solution. This is
  inadequate for many data sets that are multi-faceted and can be grouped and interpreted
  in many different ways.  Moreover, for high-dimensional data, different features
  may be relevant or irrelevant to each clustering solution, suggesting the need for
  feature selection in clustering. Features relevant to one clustering interpretation
  may be different from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation or view
  of the data.  In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian
  model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and the feature
  subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our model, the features
  in different views may be shared and therefore the sets of relevant features are
  allowed to overlap.  We model feature relevance to each view using an Indian Buffet
  Process and the cluster membership in each view using a Chinese Restaurant Process.  We
  provide an inference approach to learn the latent parameters corresponding to this
  multiple partitioning problem.  Our model not only learns the features and clusters
  in each view but also automatically learns the number of clusters, number of views
  and number of features in each view.
