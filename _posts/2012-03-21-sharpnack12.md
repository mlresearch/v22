title: Sparsistency of the Edge Lasso over Graphs
abstract: The fused lasso was proposed recently to enable recovery of high-dimensional
  patterns which are piece-wise constant on a graph, by penalizing the \ell_1-norm
  of differences of measurements at vertices that share an edge.  While there have
  been some attempts at coming up with efficient algorithms for solving the fused
  lasso optimization, a theoretical analysis of its performance is mostly lacking
  except for the simple linear graph topology. In this paper, we investigate \em sparsistency
  of  fused lasso for general graph structures, i.e. its ability to correctly recover
  the exact support of piece-wise constant graph-structured patterns asymptotically
  (for large-scale graphs). To emphasize this distinction over previous work,  we
  will refer to it as Edge Lasso. We focus on the (structured) normal means setting,
  and our results provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the graph properties
  as well as the signal-to-noise ratio needed to ensure sparsistency. We examplify
  our results using simple graph-structured patterns, and demonstrate that in some
  cases fused lasso is sparsistent at very weak signal-to-noise ratios (scaling as
  \sqrt(\log n)/|A|, where n is the number of vertices in the graph and A is the smallest
  set of vertices with constant activation).  In other cases, it performs no better
  than thresholding the difference of measurements at vertices which share an edge
  (which requires signal-to-noise ratio that scales as \sqrt\log n).
