title: History-alignment models for bias-aware prediction of virological response
  to HIV combination therapy
abstract: 'The relevant HIV data sets used for predicting outcomes of HIV combination
  therapies suffer from several problems: uneven therapy representation, different
  treatment backgrounds of the samples and uneven representation with respect to the
  level of therapy experience. Also, they comprise only viral strain(s) that can be
  detected in the patientsâ€™ blood serum. The approach presented in this paper tackles
  these issues by considering not only the most recent therapies but also the different
  treatment backgrounds of the samples making up the clinical data sets when predicting
  the outcomes of HIV therapies. For this purpose, we introduce a similarity measure
  for sequences of therapies and use it for training separate linear models for predicting
  therapy outcome for each target sample. Compared to the most commonly used approach
  that encodes all available treatment information only by specific input features
  our approach has the advantage of delivering significantly more accurate predictions
  for therapy-experienced patients and for rare therapies. Additionally, the sample-specific
  models are more interpretable which is very important in medical applications.'
