title: Quilting Stochastic Kronecker Product Graphs to Generate Multiplicative Attribute
  Graphs
abstract: We describe the first sub-quadratic sampling algorithm for Multiplicative
  Attribute Graph Model (MAGM) of Kim and Leskovec (2010). We exploit the close connection
  between MAGM and the Kronecker Product Graph Model (KPGM) of Leskovec et al. (2010),
  and show that to sample a graph from a MAGM it suffices to sample small number of
  KPGM graphs and quilt them together. Under a restricted set of technical conditions,
  our algorithm runs in O((\log_2(n))^3 |E|) time, where n is the number of nodes
  and |E| is the number of edges in the sampled graph. We demonstrate the scalability
  of our algorithm via extensive empirical evaluation; we can sample a MAGM graph
  with 8  million nodes and 20 billion edges in under 6 hours.
