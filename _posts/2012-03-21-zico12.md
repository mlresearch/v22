title: Approximate Inference in Additive Factorial HMMs with Application to Energy
  Disaggregation
abstract: 'This paper considers additive factorial hidden Markov models, an extension
  to HMMs where the state factors into multiple independent chains, and the output
  is an additive function of all the hidden states.  Although such models are very
  powerful, accurate inference is unfortunately difficult: exact inference is not
  computationally tractable, and existing approximate inference techniques are highly
  susceptible to local optima.  In this paper we propose an alternative inference
  method for such models, which exploits their additive structure by 1) looking at
  the observed difference signal of the observation, 2) incorporating a “robust” mixture
  component that can account for unmodeled observations, and 3) constraining the posterior
  to allow at most one hidden state to change at a time.  Combining these elements
  we develop a convex formulation of approximate inference that is computationally
  efficient, has no issues of local optima, and which performs much better than existing
  approaches in practice.  The method is motivated by the problem of energy disaggregation,
  the task of taking a whole home electricity signal and decomposing it into its component
  appliances; applied to this task, our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance,
  and is able to separate many appliances almost perfectly using just the total aggregate
  signal.'
