title: Maximum Margin Temporal Clustering
abstract: 'Temporal Clustering (TC) refers to the factorization of multiple time series
  into a set of non-overlapping segments that belong to k temporal clusters. Existing
  methods based on extensions of generative models such as k-means or Switching Linear
  Dynamical Systems often lead to intractable inference and lack a mechanism for feature
  selection, critical when dealing with high dimensional data. To overcome these limitations,
  this paper proposes Maximum Margin Temporal Clustering (MMTC). MMTC simultaneously
  determines the start and the end of each segment, while learning a multi-class Support
  Vector Machine to discriminate among temporal clusters. MMTC extends Maximum Margin
  Clustering in two ways: first, it incorporates the notion of TC, and second, it
  introduces additional constraints to achieve better balance between clusters. Experiments
  on clustering human actions and bee dancing motions illustrate the benefits of our
  approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.'
