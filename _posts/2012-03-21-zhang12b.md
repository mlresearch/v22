title: A Composite Likelihood View for Multi-Label Classification
abstract: Given limited training samples, learning to classify multiple labels is
  challenging. Problem decomposition is widely used in this case, where the original
  problem is decomposed into a set of easier-to-learn subproblems, and predictions
  from subproblems are combined to make the final decision. In this paper we show
  the connection between composite likelihoods and many multi-label decomposition
  methods, e.g., one-vs-all, one-vs-one, calibrated label ranking, probabilistic classifier
  chain. This connection holds promise for improving problem decomposition in both
  the choice of subproblems and the combination of subproblem decisions. As an attempt
  to exploit this connection, we design a composite marginal method that improves
  pairwise decomposition. Pairwise label comparisons, which seem to be a natural choice
  for subproblems, are replaced by bivariate label densities, which are more informative
  and natural components in a composite likelihood.  For combining subproblem decisions,
  we propose a new mean-field approximation that minimizes the notion of composite
  divergence and is potentially more robust to inaccurate estimations in subproblems.
  Empirical studies on five data sets show that, given limited training samples, the
  proposed method outperforms many alternatives.
