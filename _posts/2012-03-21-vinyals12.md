title: Krylov Subspace Descent for Deep Learning
abstract: In this paper, we propose a second order optimization method to learn models
  where both the dimensionality of the parameter space and the number of training
  samples is high.  In our method, we construct on each iteration a Krylov subspace
  formed by the gradient and an approximation to the Hessian matrix, and then use
  a subset of the training data samples to optimize over this subspace.  As with the
  Hessian Free (HF) method of Martens (2010), the Hessian matrix is never explicitly
  constructed, and is computed using a subset of data.  In practice, as in HF, we
  typically use a positive definite substitute for the Hessian matrix such as the
  Gauss-Newton matrix.  We investigate the effectiveness of our proposed method on
  deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely used methods such as
  stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent and L-BFGS, and also to
  HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either L-BFGS or HF, and generally
  performs better than either of them in cross-validation accuracy.  It is also simpler
  and more general than HF, as it does not require a positive semidefinite approximation
  of the Hessian matrix to work well nor the setting of a damping parameter.  The
  chief drawback versus HF is the need for memory to store a basis for the Krylov
  subspace.
