title: Primal-Dual methods for sparse constrained matrix completion
abstract: We develop scalable algorithms for regular and non-negative matrix completion.
  In particular, we base the methods on trace-norm regularization that induces a low
  rank predicted matrix. The regularization problem is solved via a constraint generation
  method that explicitly maintains a sparse dual and the corresponding low rank primal
  solution. We provide a new dual block coordinate descent algorithm for solving the
  dual problem with a few spectral constraints. Empirical results illustrate the effectiveness
  of our method in comparison to recently proposed alternatives.
