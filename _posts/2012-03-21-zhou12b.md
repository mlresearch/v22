title: Online Incremental Feature Learning with Denoising Autoencoders
abstract: 'While determining model complexity is an important problem in machine learning,
  many feature learning algorithms rely on cross-validation to choose an optimal number
  of features, which is usually infeasible for online learning from a massive stream
  of data. In this paper, we propose an incremental feature learning algorithm to
  determine the optimal model complexity for large-scale, online datasets based on
  the denoising autoencoder. This algorithm is composed of two processes: adding features
  and merging features. Specifically, it adds new features to minimize the objective
  functionâ€™s residual and merges similar features to obtain a compact feature representation
  and prevent over-fitting. Our experiments show that the model quickly converges
  to the optimal number of features in a large-scale online setting, and outperforms
  the (non-incremental) denoising autoencoder, as well as deep belief networks and
  stacked denoising autoencoders for classification tasks. Further, the algorithm
  is particularly effective in recognizing new patterns when the data distribution
  changes over time in the massive online data stream.'
