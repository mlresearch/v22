title: Locality Preserving Feature Learning
abstract: Locality Preserving Indexing (LPI) has been quite successful in tackling
  document analysis problems, such as clustering or classification. The approach relies
  on the Locality Preserving Criterion, which preserves the locality of the data points.
  However, LPI takes every word in a data corpus into account, even though many words
  may not be useful for document clustering. To overcome this problem, we propose
  an approach called Locality Preserving Feature Learning (LPFL), which incorporates
  feature selection into LPI. Specifically, we aim to find a subset of features, and
  learn a linear transformation to optimize the Locality Preserving Criterion based
  on these features. The resulting optimization problem is a mixed integer programming
  problem, which we relax into a constrained Frobenius norm minimization problem,
  and solve using a variation of Alternating Direction Method (ADM). ADM, which iteratively
  updates the linear transformation matrix, the residue matrix and the Lagrangian
  multiplier, is theoretically guaranteed to converge at the rate O(1/t). Experiments
  on benchmark document datasets show that our proposed method outperforms LPI, as
  well as other state-of-the-art document analysis approaches.
