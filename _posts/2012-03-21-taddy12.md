title: On Estimation and Selection for Topic Models
abstract: This article describes posterior maximization for topic models, identifying
  computational and   conceptual gains from inference under a non-standard    parametrization.  We
  then show that fitted parameters can be used  as the basis for a novel approach
  to marginal likelihood estimation,   via block-diagonal approximation to the information
  matrix, that facilitates choosing the number of latent topics.  This   likelihood-based
  model selection is complemented with a goodness-of-fit analysis built around estimated
  residual dispersion.  Examples are provided to illustrate model selection as well
  as to compare our estimation against standard alternative techniques.
