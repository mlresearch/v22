title: Age-Layered Expectation Maximization for Parameter Learning in Bayesian Networks
abstract: The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is a popular algorithm for parameter
  estimation in models with hidden variables. However, the algorithm has several non-trivial
  limitations, a significant one being variation in eventual solutions found, due
  to convergence to local optima. Several techniques have been proposed to allay this
  problem, for example initializing EM from multiple random starting points and selecting
  the highest likelihood out of all runs. In this work, we a) show that this method
  can be very expensive computationally for difficult Bayesian networks, and b) in
  response we propose an age-layered EM approach (ALEM) that efficiently discards
  less promising runs well before convergence. Our experiments show a significant
  reduction in the number of iterations, typically two- to four-fold, with minimal
  or no reduction in solution quality, indicating the potential for ALEM to streamline
  parameter estimation in Bayesian networks.
