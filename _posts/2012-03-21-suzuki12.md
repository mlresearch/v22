title: 'Fast Learning Rate of Multiple Kernel Learning: Trade-Off between Sparsity
  and Smoothness'
abstract: We investigate the learning rate of multiple kernel leaning (MKL) with L1
  and elastic-net regularizations. The elastic-net regularization is a composition
  of an L1-regularizer for inducing the sparsity and an L2-regularizer for controlling
  the smoothness. We focus on a sparse setting where the total number of kernels is
  large but the number of non-zero components of the ground truth is relatively small,
  and show sharper convergence rates than the learning rates ever shown for both L1
  and elastic-net regularizations. Our analysis shows there appears a trade-off between
  the sparsity and the smoothness when it comes to selecting which of L1 and elastic-net
  regularizations to use; if the ground truth is smooth, the elastic-net regularization
  is preferred, otherwise the L1 regularization is preferred.
