title: 'There''s a Hole in My Data Space: Piecewise Predictors for Heterogeneous Learning
  Problems'
abstract: We study statistical learning problems where the data space is multimodal
  and heterogeneous, and constructing a single global predictor is difficult. We address
  such problems by iteratively identifying high-error regions in the data space and
  learning specialized predictors for these regions. While the idea of composing localized
  predictors is not new, our approach is unique in that we actively seek out predictors
  that clump errors together, making it easier to isolate the problematic regions.
  When errors are clumped together they are also easier to interpret and resolve through
  appropriate feature engineering and data preprocessing. We present an error-clumping
  classification algorithm based on a convex optimization problem, and an efficient
  stochastic optimization algorithm for this problem. We theoretically motivate our
  approach with a novel sample complexity analysis for piecewise predictors, and empirically
  demonstrate its behavior on an illustrative classification problem.
